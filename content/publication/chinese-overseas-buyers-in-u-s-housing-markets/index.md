abstract: >-
  Using around 8 million housing transactions in California from 1994 to 2017, I
  find that Chinese over-

  seas buyers (COB) earn 4.5% lower returns than other cash buyers, controlling for market timing and

  location factors. The large gap in housing returns is driven by purchase prices instead of sale prices.

  Controlling cash payment benefits, property, and market timing, COB will pay 8-12% higher prices than

  other cash buyers. By implementing DID event study and two-way fixed effects DID models, I find that

  10% overpayment can be explained by the lack of investment opportunities arising from home-purchase

  restrictions in China. The remaining overpayment can be due to cultural differences. Combining IV and

  DID estimation, I explore the influence of COBs on U.S. local housing prices.
