My name is Gen Li. I am a Finance Ph.D. candidate at The University of British Columbia (UBC). Before joining UBC, I was a Pre-Doc research associate at Yale University and assisted finance professors with their research projects. I finished my master's degree at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
